This repository is mainly for certain configuration i have for some machines, it is not meant for production use. You can use it, but don't blame me if your box is broken :)

## Apple Macbook Pro Retina (2013)

Rigisamus is an apple mbp retina, so if you're looking for the configurations
that I have done, or if you're running Gentoo (4.14.x Kernel) you might find 
some information here quite interesting. Take a look at [rigisamus](https://github.com/foursixnine/mars-configurations/tree/master/dot-config/rigisamus)
